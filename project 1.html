<h1> MY SCHOOL </h1>
<p>I'm a freshmen at this Univesity studying both Sound Recording and Music Industry. I probably should have made this website to promote myself, but I don't have any music out at the moment. My primary goal over the next few years is soak up as much information on the music industry, performance, and music production so I haven't been too focused on publishing any work yet. That's coming up, stay tuned.

<h2> FUN STUFF </h2>
I wish all these animals were mine. I don't quite know what to put here, but animals are fun. I think my favorite one is the cat. The scene from Shrek two with Puss has me and my heart every time so this recreation is everything I could ask for. Also my gut because its a hilarious scene from what I remember, though it has been a long time since I've watched the movie and I have a terrible memory.
